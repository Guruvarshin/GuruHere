My Interests and Hobbies

I love listening to music, and I find painting and drawing deeply therapeutic. They help me express myself and bring me calm. I also enjoy reading books—the last book I read was The Book Thief, and I’m currently reading The Alchemist.

My Personality and Values

I consider myself a kind, empathetic, and driven person. I love helping others and am a dedicated tutor. One of my best qualities is my resilience—no matter how low I feel, I always get back up. I strive to stay emotionally balanced, reacting neutrally to both joy and sadness.

I’m highly focused and committed. Once I start a task, I can’t rest until I finish it—it’s how my mind works.

Strengths and Weaknesses

My greatest strength is problem-solving. I have a natural ability to spot patterns in complex problems and find effective solutions quickly—a skill I recently recognized as my personal superpower.

As for weaknesses, I tend to trust people too easily, and I can become overly absorbed in work. If something at work remains unresolved, I can’t focus on anything else until it’s settled.

Core Beliefs and Life Quote

A quote that has deeply shaped who I am comes from Osho, and my mother often reminded me of it during my childhood:

“No one is inferior, no one is superior, no one is equal either. Everyone is simply unique and incomparable.”

This philosophy has been a guiding light in my life, teaching me to appreciate individuality—both mine and others’.

Growth Areas

I’m currently working on deepening my understanding of LLMs, especially EVAL pipelines for large language models, and on improving my front-end development skills, which I feel need more refinement.

Leadership and Misconceptions

A common misconception about me is that because I’m nice, I can’t be a strong leader. In reality, I have a quiet but firm leadership style—I’m good at guiding people effectively while maintaining harmony in a team. I believe in leading with empathy and discipline.

How I Push My Limits

Since childhood, I’ve had a habit that keeps me grounded and productive: every morning, I write down three goals or tasks I must accomplish that day. This simple routine has shaped my mindset and work ethic. When faced with challenges, I break problems into smaller steps, solving them one at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed.
